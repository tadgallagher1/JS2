You will create a seven variables as described below.
Give each variable a name that makes sense, based on the value it is going to hold.

For example :

// User's first name:
var user_first_name = 'Jill';

Create seven different variables to hold each of the following values:

01. A nice message to your users:
	value: "Welcome to JavaScript!"

02. The year WW2 ended:
	value: "1945-09-02"

03. Places you would like to visit (replace the values with actual place names):
	value: ['places', 'you', 'would', 'like', 'to', 'visit']

04. Do you like Javascript?
	value: true

05. Is the user logged in to the website?
	value: false

06. description of a fictitional character
	value: {firstName: 'Star', lastName: 'Lord', movie: 'Space Avengers'}

07. pi, the tastiest number
	value: 3.141592653

After you have created all of these variables, log them all to the console as shown below:

*/

var welcomeMessage = 'Welcome to JavaScript!';
