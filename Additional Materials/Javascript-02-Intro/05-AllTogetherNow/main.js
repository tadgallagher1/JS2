// All together now!

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Here is where you put everything together.
// Your task is to combine all the knowledge learned in slides and previous exercises.
// You are going to create some variables, some functions, and select some DOM
// ( Not necessarily in that order. )
//
// Your tasks are as follows :
// 1. Create a variable and store your name in it.
//    a. Select the h1 with a class of greetings and change its innerText to "Hello, [YOURNAME]!"
//
// 2. Create a function that will update the contents of the danger/warning/alert tags:
//    a. In the danger box, update the text to "Your changes will be lost!"
//    b. In the warning box, update the text to "If you are cool with losing your changes, so am I."
//    c. in the success box, update the text to "Just kidding, your changes are saved :P"
//
// 3. Create a single function that will accept a string containing the weather status, and
//    update all three of the following DOM elements:
//    a. Update the user name to display the contents of the variable you created that holds your name.
//    b. Update the weather status with the weather status string that was passed in to your function.
//    c. The current year should be updated to reflect the current year. (Hint: Google "javascript get current year")
